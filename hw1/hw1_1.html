    <h3 style="color: #8e99e1;"><b>PROLOGUE</b></h3>
    <p>Two housenolds, both alike in dignity,<br>
       In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
       From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
       Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
       From forth the fata loinsof these two foes<br>
       A pair of star-cross'd lovers Lake their life<br>
       Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
       Do with their death bury their parents'strife.<br>
       The fearful passageof their death-mark'd love,<br>
       And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
       Which, but ther chldren's end, nought could remove,<br>
       15 now the two hours'traffic of our stage;<br>
       The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
       What here shall miss, our toil shal stive 10 mend
